This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data course at CMU.

# About me
Check out my profile [here](https://dc0708.github.io/).

# What I hope to learn
It is my passion to build products that help transform lives of the people. With this class, I would want to understand how to use data to not only convey stories and aspects in forms where people are able to understand easily, but also to persuade people using data to make decisions that eventually help build the world in a better way.
