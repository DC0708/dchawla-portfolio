This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data course at CMU.

# About me

# What I hope to learn
It is my passion to build products that help transform lives of the people. With this class, I would want to understand how to use data to not only convey stories and aspects in forms where people are able to understand at a glance, but also to persuade people using data to make decisions that eventually help build the world in a better way.  

# Portfolio
All the stuff that I learn and try out will go here!
