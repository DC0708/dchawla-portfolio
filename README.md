This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data course at CMU.

# About me
Check out my profile [here](https://dc0708.github.io/).

# What I hope to learn
It is my passion to build products that help transform lives of the people. With this class, I would want to understand how to use data to not only convey stories and aspects in forms where people are able to understand easily, but also to persuade people using data to make decisions that eventually help build the world in a better way.  

# Portfolio
Here follows the work done in the course : 

# Assignment-1

Below is the work regarding my first assignment.
It hopefully is a better visualization (both in terms of context and design) with respect to the bar graph in the article [“The Metamorphosis.” The Economist, August 13, 2016.](https://www.economist.com/britain/2016/08/13/the-metamorphosis)

# Assignment-2 : OIG data visualization 

Source and data information : [DHS Report on dangerous overcrowding and prolonged detention of children and adults](https://www.oig.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/assets/Mga/2019/oig-19-51-jul19.pdf)

Here is visualization as per DHS Analyst : 
The main audience is considered to be high-level policy-makers at DHS as well as other government agencies. I have started the visualization by stating the problem that is more incoming detainees and broken down it by segment. Then to further dive down into where the problem might lie and give deeper insights of border patrol and ICE, I have added the main two data visualizations relating to capacity at border patrol and funding at ICE. I added the last two visualizations to make sure the policy makers know where border patrol and ICE are facing problems(that is capacity and funding to manage the capacity).

Here is visualization as per Data Journalist :

I have added this visualization based on what a normal reader might be interested in. That is why, I have kept it simple to make sure the reader understand the large scale problem is there because of large rise in detainees. I have kept out the problems faced by border patrol as they might be of less interest to the everyday reader.

# Assignment-3 : Data visualization critique #2

Source and information : [BJP(Ruling Govt party in India) Tweet](https://twitter.com/BJP4India/status/1039110217160478720) 

The tweet above is aimed to describe to the twitter followers that petrol prices decreased during the last 5 years of tenure of BJP but it is represented inaccurately, not only in terms of scale, but also in terms of labels on axis. I have made the visualization better scaled, better labeled and translated headings in english. I have made the changes from the point of view of BJP promoting itself to the reader. Therefore, the increase and percentage increase in petrol prices are shown.
